After some intense work, we have finally completed our super computer, the Labvoratory Mind.
Now we need super problem to test its capabilities.
Square roots, cube roots, 4th roots... such things are far too boring for the Laboratory Mind.
It needs to find the super root! With your help we will almost certainly find it together.
